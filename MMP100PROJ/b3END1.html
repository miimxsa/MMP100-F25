    <p>You walk for what feels like hours byet you finally reach home.

        As you enter inside you come to see a perfect version of your life.  Everyone's happy but you cannot shake the feeling that something feels missing. You notice someone, or something rather, is watching through the window. You realize this is a trap of comfort, and leaving gets harder the longer you stay.
        
        You are trapped!</p>

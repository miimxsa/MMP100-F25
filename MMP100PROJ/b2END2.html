    <p>You walk through the portal and quickly the air grows heavy and the lights flicker red. A metallic door creaks open on its own, revealing a massive, walled dystopian society yet it is ruled by dogs.

        Towering greyhounds in armor patrol the streets.
        
        Youre led through the city: factories for chew toys with barcodes, pups in training camps, everything watched by drone. Everything is strict. Precise. Leashed.

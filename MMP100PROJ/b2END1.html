    <p>You walk the endless hallway, expecting more silence but a soft meow echoes ahead.

        You follow it.
        
        The air warms. The walls shift, opening into a sunlit garden hidden between realities. Cats literally could be thousands of them lounging, playing, napping in patches of light. They look up as you enter. One with a little crown pads over and nods .
        
        You are now one of them.
        
        You curl up in the sun. The hallway is gone.</p>
